Place your project image file here and name it `project1.jpg` so the portfolio will show it in the first project.

Path: assets/project1.jpg

If you want me to add a different filename, tell me and I'll update `index.html` accordingly.

Tip: Copy the image file into this folder (keep dimensions around 800px tall or less for best performance).
